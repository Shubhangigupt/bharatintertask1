        <h2><u>About Gorilla</u></h2>
      </center>
      <p>Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter and sadness.
        In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins after
        chimpanzees and bonobos. The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and
        shoulders, large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in
        equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland
        subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to more than 50, led by a
        dominant adult male‚Äîor silverback‚Äîwho holds his position for years. The bond between the silverback and his
        females forms the basis of gorilla social life.</p>

        <h2><u>Chicken Biryani</u></h2>
      </center>
      <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with Indian spices,
        vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat, or in some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in
        addition, eggs and potatoes. </p>

        <h2><u>Cycle Of Life</u></h2>
      </center>
      <p>Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts the life cycle of an
        entrepreneur in perspective. Failure won‚Äôt kill you, if you don‚Äôt let it. Experiencing this can give you more
        courage to try again. Even when you ‚Äòmake it‚Äô and raise a lot of money or sell your company, life isn‚Äôt over.
        You might unfortunately, have a much clearer picture of the struggles, but then you get to start again with a
        new startup, or become an angel investor yourself.</p>

      </center>
      <p>Delhi‚Äôs Qutub Minar, at 72.5 meters or 238 feet tall, is the tallest tower in India. Built as an Islamic
        monument in the early 13th century of red sandstone and marble, the minar is not without controversy. Some
        believe the tower was built to celebrate Muslim rule in the country, and others claim it was erected to call
        the devoted to prayer.</p>
